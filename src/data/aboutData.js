    "My journey began at the age of eight when I stumbled upon a YouTube video about Python coding. The concept of creating custom text on a screen with a few lines of code fascinated me, and I was immediately hooked. I devoted my time and effort to learning Python, and subsequently, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Javascript. After a brief hiatus, I further expanded my knowledge by learning node.js and the basics of discord.js, allowing me to develop and code Discord bots. I, like many others, aspire to pursue a career in backend development, and my ultimate goal is to attend the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to achieve this. My journey has taught me the importance of perseverance and dedication, and I hope that my experience inspires others to pursue their passions.",
